# DroidTracker
DroidTracker is a running tracker application developed for the Android operating system. It tracks the user location whilst running, providing real-time weather updates. It provides automated categorization of runs based on weather, and it allows tagging the runs as different exercise types (run, walk, jog), providing an average speed across all runs of that type.

This project showcases the ability to utilize all fundamental Android components, in particular foreground services, and to interface with multiple external API to provide novel and useful features to the user.
